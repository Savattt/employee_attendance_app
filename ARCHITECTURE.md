# Employee Attendance App - Architecture

## Overview

This app uses a **hybrid architecture** combining **Firebase** and **Laravel** for optimal performance and reliability.

## Current Architecture

### 🔥 Firebase (Primary - Working Now)

- **Authentication**: User login/logout
- **Firestore Database**: Real-time data storage
- **Cloud Messaging**: Push notifications
- **Hosting**: Web app (if needed)

### 🐘 Laravel (Secondary - For Future)

- **REST API**: Business logic and data processing
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: Structured data storage
- **Advanced Features**: Reporting, analytics, integrations

## Data Flow

```
[Flutter App]
    ↓
[Firebase Auth] → [Firebase Firestore] → [Real-time Updates]
    ↓
[Laravel API] → [MySQL Database] → [Advanced Features]
```

## Configuration

### Switch Between Firebase and Laravel

In `lib/config/api_config.dart`:

```dart
static bool get useFirebase {
  return true; // Use Firebase (working)
  // return false; // Use Laravel API (when ready)
}
```

## Features by Backend

### Firebase (Current)

## Migration Path

1. **Phase 1**: Use Firebase for all features (current)
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate to Laravel API gradually
3. **Phase 3**: Use both - Firebase for real-time, Laravel for business logic

## Benefits

- **Firebase**: Fast development, real-time, reliable
- **Laravel**: Scalable, secure, feature-rich
- **Hybrid**: Best of both worlds

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Get app working with Firebase
